# resolution-go

resolution-go is a library for interacting with blockchain domain names. It can be used to retrieve [payment addresses](https://unstoppabledomains.com/features#Add-Crypto-Addresses), IPFS hashes for [decentralized websites](https://unstoppabledomains.com/features#Build-Website), DNS records and other [records types](https://docs.unstoppabledomains.com/domain-registry-essentials/records-reference)

resolution-go is primarily built and maintained by [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/).
